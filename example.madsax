#The next line is a tag declaration.
#It tells madsax to generate a group
#of functions(open&close) for each tag.
/svg

#/svg/defs is nested under /svg. So
#madsax will generate
#an open(/svg) followed by pairs of
#open(/svg/defs/) & close(/svg/devs)
#for any nested <defs> tags
#before the close(/svg)
/svg/defs
/svg/defs/linearGradient #Comments can also go here
/svg/defs/style

/svg/rect
/svg/circle
/svg/line
/svg/polyline
